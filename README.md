# webapp-data-visualization

Overview:
This project is a web-based application for data analysis and visualization. It reads data from a raw CSV file provided by the user, processes the data using Python and Pandas, and generates insightful visualizations using ChartJS. The entire app is built using Django, enabling a robust and scalable web application.

Technologies used:
Python: Programming language used for backend development.
Django: Framework used for building the web application.
Pandas: Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
Tailwind CSS: Utilities used for web page designing.
ChartJS: Library used for creating interactive and responsive charts for data visualization.

Building the Web App:
CSV File Handling: The app allows users to upload a CSV file in a predefined format. This file is then read and converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
Data Display: The raw data is rendered in a tabular format on an HTML page using Django templates.
Data Analysis & Visualization: The data is analyzed using Pandas, and the results are visualized using ChartJS. The visualizations are then displayed on the web page, providing the user with insights derived from the data.
